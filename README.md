# Square-Multiply
Square Multiply vs basic Python maths

This script will calculate the forumla ((x^y) mod n) e.g. ((3^45) mod 7).
It will do so by using normal "Python maths" i.e. simply typing the formula into Python and letting it calculate the result.
It will then calculate using the Sqaure Multiply method. You can then compare the results of both methods.
The answers should be the same but the time taken should be drastically shorter for the Square Multiply method.
